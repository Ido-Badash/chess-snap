# ChessSnap ‚ôüÔ∏èüì∏

ChessSnap is a cross-platform Flutter app (mobile & web) designed for chess enthusiasts who want to seamlessly bridge physical and digital play.

## Project Vision

**ChessSnap** lets you snap a photo of a real chessboard, instantly recreates the position in the app, and allows you to play from there‚Äîsolo or with friends. Multiplayer is built around easy sharing via link or code, with LAN-based connections for smooth, private games. A flexible theming system, future AI integration, and an open database for tracking matches are all part of the roadmap.

## Features

- **Image-to-Board Conversion**
  - Take a photo of a chessboard and recreate it virtually in the app.
  - (Powered by a custom image analysis backend, handled by a project partner.)

- **Play from Any Position**
  - Start playing from any scanned board position.
  - Play solo or against another player.

- **Multiplayer Support**
  - Invite friends via link or code.
  - Multiplayer games run over LAN for privacy and low latency.
  - Option to play offline.

- **Themes**
  - Customize your experience with a variety of board and piece themes.

- **Match Database (Planned)**
  - Track your games and progress with a free, open database.

- **AI Opponent (Future)**
